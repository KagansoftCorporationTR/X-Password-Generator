# X Password Generator
Has your account been hacked? Did you reuse the same password since 1999?
No, your account wasn't hacked... yet. You're probably here because your current password is still 123456 or maybe your childhood pet's name. It's time to stop the madness!

The X Passowrd Generator is here to bring you back from the brink of digital disaster. We generate cryptographically secure passwords that even your 1990s dial-up modem couldn't crack. Forget using the same password across MySpace, ICQ, and your other accounts. Use the X Password Generator and make every hacker's day miserable.

# Key Features

- Mandatory Length: Enforces a hard minimum password length of 30 characters (configurable via the MIN_LENGTH constant) to defeat modern brute-force attacks.
- Guaranteed Complexity: Every generated password is guaranteed to include at least one character from all four main sets: Uppercase (A-Z), Lowercase (a-z), Digits (0-9), Symbols (!@#$, etc.)
- Batch Generation: Supports generating multiple unique passwords in a single run, providing efficiency for bulk security updates.

This Project Builded with Visual Studio 2015.
